# Spoti

This Python code enables the user to input a Spotify playlist URI via Command line.

Upon verification from Spotify's API, song features are downloaded, 
converted into a Pandas dataframe and then saved into an Excel spreedsheet. 

Using Python's MatPlotlib, the results are graphed and presented in a 3D model.

Also, the graphs are saved into a PDF. 

Please see example of downloaded results.

Enjoy!
